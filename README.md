# Next.js Blank Screen on About Page with Delayed Load

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where a page displays a blank screen initially, before content eventually renders after a delay. The problem is caused by a slow load time that's not properly handled within Next.js's rendering mechanism. This leads to a blank or partially rendered page before the content is completely loaded.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` component simulates a slow loading scenario with a 3-second delay before content is rendered. This causes the initial render to be blank for 3 seconds before the actual content is displayed. This behavior can be frustrating for users and might give the impression that the page is broken.

## Solution

The solution utilizes a loading indicator to improve user experience while content is loading. This approach provides visual feedback to users that something is happening, thereby minimizing confusion caused by the delay.
